### Links

## My process

I started with planning the layout, effects and html structure.

Then I set up my coding evironment and got to coding. After writing the basic html and applying the necessary css styles and effects I got to making the site responsive. This was the hardest part as I haven't worked with implementing responsiveness on a full page layout before. This was a bit challenging, but I think that it turned out pretty well.

Also, I coded a custom scrollbar, just for fun, thought that the default one was pretty boring.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### What I learned

In this project I learned:

- How to implement a responsiveness on a full page layout
- How to work with Font Awesome and add icons to a page
- How to create a custom scrollbar

### Continued development

I will continue doing projects on Frontend Mentor and improving my frontend skills.
